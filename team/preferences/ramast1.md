# Preferences for _Rachel Masters_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It is easiest to reach me via text or email, any hours are fine, but I may take a while to respond if I am in a meeting.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectations are that my team will create a cool product that shows evidence that we learned the new skills that were taught to us.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goals are to work to communicate often and efficiently so that our group can work as a coherent unit.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I have a very busy schedule which is always an obstacle that takes away from my time, but by budgeting time to meet with the group into my schedule, I should be able to surpass this challenge.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Being a student who does want to get an "A", I would encourage my team members not to settle with a "B" and really give their all to the project. I believe that everyone in my group is very capable of getting an "A", even if I do not know them very well yet. I will try to help foster the group success and expect my teammates to do their best on their assignments.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe that if everyone is truly pulling their weight and doing their best, we will get an "A", so if some team members are doing more work to get an "A", it is probably a situation where someone else is not doing the work they are supposed to, which is not acceptable.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I would say 9 hours because that is the time that we signed up to put in by taking the 3 credit course.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I believe that everyone should have a voice in how activities are divided up, and we should work together on them at our meetings to get the tasks done.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I would say we should make a policy about it. Unless there is a really good reason, the first time could be a strike or something like that, and we could work together as a group to correct the issue. If it is a repeat offense, maybe we could get the instructor involved.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We should make our expectations for work quality clear, and we should always be working to improve the quality of our work above and beyond the expectations we set.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as they do not miss deadlines, I do not mind any work habits that anyone has. If they do start missing deadlines, then it will be an issue to discuss.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, we have already worked out a schedule.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * The way the schedule is made, the team will meet for 9 hours a week together to work on things. This should help keep everyone accountable.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * We should get all team members approval before making a decision, but if a teammate does not respond in a timely fashion it may be necessary to make a decision without. We could come up with a response time window that we use for all decisions.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I will try to understand why they disagree and hear out their idea. Then, as a group, if we still do not all agree, I will encourage the group to find a middle ground. If no middle ground can be found, we may have to take a majority vote.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I will communicate with them and encourage those who are less involved to speak up.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will sit down with the group and discuss the imbalance that I feel and see if there is a way we can work together to rectify the issue.
