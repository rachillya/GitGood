# Preferences for Amy Felix

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * The best way to reach me is either by email or call me. I wouldn't say I like texting people; usually, I text them back two days later if it's over text. I am available from 7 am to 10pm. 
2. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we are to have a running project to demonstrate to others our skills.
3. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to get the habit of asking for help from my team and perfect my communication skills to prevent being the lonely wolf.
4. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I am in my last semester, and I am currently working on the next step after graduating. However, this doesn't stop me from helping my team to succeed this semester. 
5. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an "A" while others think a "B" will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would agree with another student that "B" is acceptable, but since we are a team, we can't be selfish and let our grade be a "B." I would encourage my team and myself to push themselves to do great on the assignment. 
   It's going to be a rough semester, but I believe if we have good communication within the team, we can succeed to get an "A" in the course
6. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an "A"?__ 
   * Of course not. There is no I in the word team.
7. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It's going to be nine hours, due to the fact, this course is a three-credit course.
8. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I don't think there should be one person to have the final decision; instead, the whole team should agree on what to do on the project. Of course, there will be someone who comes with the idea at first, but it shouldn't be finalized without having everyone on board.
9. __What will happen if someone doesn't follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If this becomes a constant issue, I would discuss with the rest of my teammates if they have any other ideas on how to approach this issue. Otherwise, we would take this issue with the instructor. Unexpected events happen, and as college students, it's understood that we are all adults and starting to become dependable. However, we are a team, and we need to communicate with each other.
10. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I would encourage them to do quality work since the instructor stated that this course isn't about finishing the work and move on on the first day of class. This course is to grow and improve skills as a team and individual. 
11. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I understand everyone has different work habits, which doesn't bother me as long as they turn it in before the deadline. 
   However, I prefer they don't finish their part of the project at the last minute. For instance, if the assignment is due on Friday at 10 pm and they turn it in at 8 pm with many bugs. Then there is stress not only to one student but to the whole. If this becomes an issue, it must be discussed how we can help them with their work habits.
12. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * At the moment, we have a worked-out schedule. 
13. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * We currently have 9 hours a week to work together to work on the project. 
14. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think we should have all vote before making a final decision. 
15. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I would like to understand their point of view on why that one student disagrees. Then talk with the team to find a middle ground to proceed. If we don't find a middle ground, I would either encourage to talk with the instructor if he has any ideas on how to proceed or take a majority vote to proceed. 
16. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   *  I would like to speak within my team and encourage those to join us. We all have that "shy moment," but we should treat our team as family.
17. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would like to make an appointment with my teammates and ask for help.
