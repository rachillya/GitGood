# Preferences for _Alex Wedel_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * 1st text, then slack, then email. I'm usually awake by 9am and asleep around 1am so any time between that would be best.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I believe we should shoot for finishing all possible tasks, even if it's unrealistic. As long as we have a working project we can feel proud of I will be content.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goal is to not get sidetracked and to comment my code more.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * We could possibly have interior conflicts between people or ideas. I get sidetracked easily when I am not interested in what I am working on.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * The group needs to have a full discussion about their expectations for the project.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If the group has set out to earn an "A" grade, then no. If everyone including that person is okay with a "B" and they want to make the extra push, that should be fine.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It may take about 10-12 hours a week per person to be successful.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should all coordinate to delegate tasks based on prior experience and strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Mention that in our sprint report and speak with the person who isn't following through.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Expectations need to be made explicit and the work should be checked by another member of our team.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as communication is consistent and expectations are clear, there shouldn't be an issue. Any issues should be discussed between the team and possibly Dave.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes. It seems like we are close to picking a time for that already.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once or twice a week in person and at least once or twice a week over Zoom, Teams, etc.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think it depends on the importance of the decision. If it is overall design or functionality based, then likely. For semantics, only one or two members need to approve.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Seek for a compromise, but if one cannot be made, go with the majority
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Try to speak with them privately and if no change is made, try to make it a group discussion point.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Mention it to the group first, then message people individually for assistance if no one offers initially.
