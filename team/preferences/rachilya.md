# Preferences for _Rachel Wagner_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I can be reached easiest by text and email. Anytime is fine, but I generally respond the fastest after seven pm during weekdays.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect my team to successfully complete all our work this semester and to learn valuable skills.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * One goal I have for myself is to get better at reaching out to people as well as responding to them in a timely fashion. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * The only obstacles I can see with these goals are things like time and unexpected situations that are out of our control.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * With grades, it is always better to aim higher so that if you fail to reach it, at least you can still hit somewhere high.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * There should be no need for anyone to do more work than others. Everyone should be able to do an even amount of work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Since this is a three credit course, it should take about nine hours a week to make the project successful.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will have a discussion to see who feels comfortable doing what.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If it is a rare occurence, I think it can slide with a good enough explanation. However, if someone continually fails
   * to follow through, then it is time to get the instuctor involved.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think we need to define a group opinion of quality of work from the very beginning.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * First, we should see if those difference can aline in some way. If they cannot, we should figure out some compromises.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I don't think it should be set in stone or mandatory. We should make it something flexible, at least to some extent.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should aim to meet at least three times a week, and at the very least once with everyone in the team.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Generally speaking, yes. Unless it is something minor that will not effect much, I think every decision needs approval.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to find a compromise that everyone can be happy with.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I'm a bit of a sheep, so I tend to follow along with people who think to take charge. If it seems like others want to
   * get in their opinions though, I would help them get a word in.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask my teammates to help out. That's what being a team means.
