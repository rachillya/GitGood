# Preferences for _Jennifer Coburn_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Reaching me via Slack is best and Teams for meetings since I'm an online student. I'm available from 4pm - 8pm (Mountain time) every weekday.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Collaboratively deliver a product that meets the Product Owner's expectations.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * For teamwork, it's my goal to stay focused on the required task assigned instead of persuing other side projects. It's also my goal to promptly reach out if I get stuck.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I think it's posible for team members to clash, avoid being proactive, shy away from helping others, and accepting or recieving constructive criticism.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If the "B" member is capable but avoiding work they should expect pushback and critisism. However, if the "B" member is trying their best then other team members should  provide more assistance.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No way! It's my hope the scrum process will divy up the work fairly, so all members can achieve an "A".
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I guess it'll take a few hours every day.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should each volunteer to take on work based on our personal goals or strengths. If it works out that the task was quick and easy then members should reach out and help others reach the finish line.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should found out why so we can avoid it next time.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Members should provide work that meets the requirents. After that, we should provide helpfull feedback right away and respect each others' preferences.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think different work habits are great so long as they aren't a detriment to progress. If so, it should be brought up privately and continuation of disruptive habit should be mentioned to the professor. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Sure, any time after 4pm. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Maybe we should meet on Teams once or twice a week. Maybe we can avoid some meetings if we communicate our progress or issues often over Slack.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think we should vote on big decisions.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * The member who doesn't agree should feel free to speak their opinion and persuade the group. However, I think we should go with the majority for simplicity. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Sometimes it's necessary if team is too shy to communicate or isn't in general very proactive. However, if there is a member that is agressive then team members should let them know.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'll ask for help. If a team member is overwhelmed, they can feel free to reach to me and I'll try my best to help them.
