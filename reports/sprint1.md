## Planned Epics
The first epic that we are planning to take on in Sprint 1 is Team Identification.

All these tasks will help people know information about our team. In this Epic 
there are three tasks in Team Identification which are: set the team number and name on 
the server, set the team number and name in the client, and set the team name in the
browser tab. 

The second epic that we are planning to take on in Sprint 1 is About.

Within the About Epic, we will introduce all the individual members in the teams.
The tasks in About is adding an images from team member, the individual's name, and short
bio to share. This will help others get to know the people behind the project.

## Review

#### Epics completed  
We were able to complete the two epics: Team Identification and About. 
We were able to complete all epics by having good communication and time management.  

#### Epics not completed 
Our team was able to complete both epics that we took on for this sprint. Taking into account our impediments during 
this sprint, we believe we will be able to accomplish even more in the upcoming sprint than we have in this first one.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well
  We communicated early on in Slack and we were able to commit to set meeting times throughout the week. Also, we were unafraid
  to look and tinker with GitHub and ZenHub so we got a good head start. Amazingly, we did a good job helping each other trouble
  shoot and get familiarized with the new technology. We met all expectations for Definition of Done in this sprint and we finished 
  all task in a timely manner so could review each otherâ€™s code. We recoreded our meetings for those of us that were unable to attend.

#### Things that we need to improve
We need to remember to have our Daily Scrums every day.
We tend to jump right into troubleshooting at our daily meetings, and that leads us to forget the scrum.
The other thing we could work on improving is reaching out with our resources to aid our classmates.

#### One thing we will change next time
One thing we plan to change in the next Sprint is to complete more epics than in Sprint 1.
