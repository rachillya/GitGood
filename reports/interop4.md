# Interop for t02

Interoperability testing allows us to verify correct operation when connected to another team's client or server.
Each team member must verify interoperability with the client and server from another team.
Each of the different aspects of the protocol must be verified.
We will discuss these issues with the other team and create defects in GitHub for any problems found in our system.
