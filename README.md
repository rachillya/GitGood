# Team Preferences
For team communications, we will keep an eye on the slack daily and keep it as our primary communication source. As a team, by the end of this class, we expect that we are to 
have a running project to demonstrate to others our skills. Furthermore, we expect to collaboratively deliver a product that meets the Product Owner's expectations. This means we 
should shoot to finish all possible tasks, even if it's unrealistic.

We are looking to improve our communication and teamwork this semester. Our group goals are to promptly reach out and communicate with each other when we need help and to not 
get sidetracked from the overall project. We also need to keep good documentation of what we do. We all are busy people, so it is essential to stick to our scheduling and 
communication. The other obstacle we may encounter is people having different ideas, which also just will require communication.

We all agreed that we want to get an "A" in the course. By that, with excellent communication, we will get an "A" in the course.  In addition, we all agree that it's not 
acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment. There is no "I" in the word "team." We should be dividing the work and working as a team. As a team, we 
anticipate it will take 9 hours to have a successful project because it's a three-credit course. We have decided who should do what in the project by first coordinating to 
delegate tasks based on prior experience and strengths

We came to the consensus that if someone falls through on their commitment without a good excuse, the team will allow for three mishaps before bringing the issue forward in a 
group meeting. If we canâ€™t solve an issue, we agree to reach out to Prof. Mathews to provide guidance. We will strive to provide quality work that meets the definition of done and 
meets the clean code standards. Furthermore, we will strive to write code that includes comments. For deadlines, we agree to finish in a timely manner so that the work can be 
reviewed by another team member should an unexpected issue arise.

We as a team already are planning to meet multiple times a week when four or all of us are free. We plan to adjust our meeting schedule based on the requirements of the class 
and our position in the sprint. Currently, we are planning to meet three to four times a week for an hour or two each meeting. This includes a mix of both in person meetups as 
well as meetings over Teams. Depending on the scale of the decisions being made, we think everyone should voice their opinion. If the decision is minor, then probably not every 
team member but at least one.
    
If there is ever something that not everyone in the team agrees on, we will try to seek a compromise; however, if one cannot be made, we will go with what the majority agrees 
on. Additionally, if the problem that one person is dominating the team process ever arises, we will all try to talk about it to let that person know what they are doing and that 
they need to let the others get involved as well. We will also effectively communicate with each other so that our teammates can ask for help if they feel they have too many 
responsibilities.
